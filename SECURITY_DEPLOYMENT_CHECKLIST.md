# Security System Deployment Checklist

Use this checklist when deploying the new security system to ensure a smooth transition.

## Pre-Deployment

- [ ] **Review Configuration**
  - [ ] Generate a strong JWT secret key (at least 256 bits for HS256)
  - [ ] Set appropriate token expiration times
  - [ ] Configure CORS settings for your environment
  - [ ] Review logging levels

- [ ] **Test Client Applications**
  - [ ] Update client applications to handle refresh tokens
  - [ ] Test token refresh flow
  - [ ] Test logout flow with token revocation
  - [ ] Verify error handling for expired tokens

- [ ] **Run Tests**
  - [ ] Run all unit tests
  - [ ] Run integration tests
  - [ ] Test with feature toggle enabled
  - [ ] Test with feature toggle disabled (fallback)

- [ ] **Create Database Backup**
  - [ ] Backup user data
  - [ ] Backup authentication-related tables

- [ ] **Prepare Rollback Plan**
  - [ ] Document steps to disable new security system
  - [ ] Prepare rollback scripts if needed
  - [ ] Test rollback procedure

## Deployment

- [ ] **Deploy Backend Changes**
  - [ ] Deploy new code with feature toggle disabled
  - [ ] Verify application starts correctly
  - [ ] Check logs for any startup errors

- [ ] **Enable Feature Toggle**
  - [ ] Update application.properties to enable new security system
  - [ ] Restart application or update configuration

- [ ] **Verify Deployment**
  - [ ] Test login with new system
  - [ ] Test protected endpoints
  - [ ] Test token refresh
  - [ ] Test logout

- [ ] **Monitor Application**
  - [ ] Watch for authentication errors in logs
  - [ ] Monitor performance metrics
  - [ ] Check for unexpected exceptions

## Post-Deployment

- [ ] **Test All Features**
  - [ ] Verify all protected endpoints work correctly
  - [ ] Test all authentication flows
  - [ ] Test edge cases (expired tokens, invalid tokens)

- [ ] **Update Documentation**
  - [ ] Update API documentation with new authentication details
  - [ ] Document any changes for client developers
  - [ ] Update internal documentation

- [ ] **Train Support Team**
  - [ ] Explain new error messages and troubleshooting
  - [ ] Review common issues and solutions
  - [ ] Provide escalation path for security issues

- [ ] **Plan Legacy System Removal**
  - [ ] Set timeline for removing legacy code
  - [ ] Identify dependencies on legacy system
  - [ ] Plan code cleanup

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 401 Unauthorized Errors

- Check that tokens are being sent correctly in the Authorization header
- Verify token expiration times
- Check if token is blacklisted
- Enable DEBUG logging for security components

### Token Refresh Issues

- Verify refresh token is valid and not expired
- Check if refresh token is being sent correctly
- Verify refresh token endpoint is accessible

### CORS Issues

- Check CORS configuration in application.properties
- Verify allowed origins, methods, and headers
- Test with specific origins rather than wildcard (*) if possible

### Performance Issues

- Monitor token validation performance
- Check blacklist size and cleanup
- Consider Redis for token blacklist in high-traffic environments
