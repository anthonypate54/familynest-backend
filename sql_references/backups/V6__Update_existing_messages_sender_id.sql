-- This migration is now a no-op since sender_username column doesn't exist yet at this point
-- It will be added in V13 and populated there.
-- Original SQL:
-- UPDATE message m
-- SET sender_id = (
--     SELECT id 
--     FROM app_user u 
--     WHERE u.username = m.sender_username
-- )
-- WHERE m.sender_id IS NULL;
