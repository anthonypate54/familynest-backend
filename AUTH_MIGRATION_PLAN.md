# Authentication System Migration Plan

This document outlines the plan for migrating from the legacy authentication system to the new JWT-based authentication system.

## Overview

The new authentication system provides several improvements:

- Centralized JWT token management
- Token blacklisting for improved security
- Standardized exception handling
- Better password validation
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Improved code organization and separation of concerns

## Components

The new authentication system consists of the following components:

1. **JWT Service**: Handles token generation, validation, and parsing
2. **Token Blacklist Service**: Manages revoked tokens
3. **Security Exception**: Standardized exception handling for security-related errors
4. **JWT Authentication Filter**: Intercepts requests to validate JWT tokens
5. **Security Config**: Configures Spring Security with the new JWT filter
6. **User Service**: Handles user-related operations
7. **Authentication Service**: Orchestrates authentication flow
8. **Controllers**: Updated to use the new authentication system

## Migration Steps

### Phase 1: Development and Testing (Current)

1. ✅ Create the new authentication components in a separate package
2. ✅ Implement tests for the new components
3. ✅ Fix any compilation errors or issues
4. ✅ Ensure tests pass

### Phase 2: Controller Migration

1. ✅ Update `AuthController` to use the new authentication system
2. ✅ Update `PasswordResetController` to use the new authentication system
3. ⬜ Update `UserController` to use the new authentication system
4. ⬜ Update other controllers that use authentication
5. ⬜ Ensure all tests pass after each controller update

### Phase 3: Integration and Testing

1. ⬜ Integrate the new authentication filter into the main application
2. ⬜ Update the security configuration to use the new filter
3. ⬜ Test the application with the new authentication system
4. ⬜ Fix any issues that arise during testing

### Phase 4: Deployment

1. ⬜ Create a database backup before deployment
2. ⬜ Deploy the new authentication system to the staging environment
3. ⬜ Test the staging environment thoroughly
4. ⬜ Deploy to production during a maintenance window
5. ⬜ Monitor for any issues after deployment

### Phase 5: Cleanup

1. ⬜ Remove the legacy authentication code
2. ⬜ Update documentation
3. ⬜ Conduct a final review of the authentication system

## Rollback Plan

If issues are encountered during deployment, follow these steps to roll back:

1. Restore the previous version of the application
2. Restore the database backup if necessary
3. Verify that the application is functioning correctly with the old authentication system

## Testing Strategy

Each component and controller should be tested thoroughly:

- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for the authentication flow
- End-to-end tests for the entire application

## Timeline

- Phase 1: Complete
- Phase 2: In progress
- Phase 3: Planned for next sprint
- Phase 4: Planned for the following sprint
- Phase 5: Planned for after successful deployment

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Incompatible changes break existing functionality | High | Medium | Thorough testing, gradual rollout |
| Performance issues with new system | Medium | Low | Performance testing before deployment |
| Security vulnerabilities | High | Low | Security review, penetration testing |
| User sessions lost during migration | Medium | Medium | Plan deployment during low-traffic period |

## Conclusion

This migration plan provides a structured approach to updating the authentication system while minimizing risks and ensuring a smooth transition. By following this plan, we can improve the security and maintainability of the authentication system without disrupting the user experience.
