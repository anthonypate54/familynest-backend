# Spring Boot Application Rollback System

This system provides a reliable way to roll back Spring Boot applications to previous working versions in case of deployment failures or issues.

## Directory Structure

```
rollback-system/
├── versions/              # Stores versioned JAR files
├── configs/               # Stores backed-up configuration files
├── scripts/               # Contains all rollback and deployment scripts
│   ├── backup.sh          # Creates backups of JARs and configs
│   ├── deploy.sh          # Deploys new versions with safety checks
│   ├── rollback.sh        # Rolls back to previous working version
│   └── health-check.sh    # Validates application health
├── logs/                  # Logs of deployments and rollbacks
└── tests/                 # Test scenarios for the rollback system
```

## Testing Plan

1. **Local Testing Environment**
   - Create multiple versions of the application with minor differences
   - Set up test configurations that mimic production
   - Create a local PostgreSQL database for testing

2. **Test Scenarios**
   - Scenario 1: Normal deployment works correctly
   - Scenario 2: Deployment fails, automatic rollback triggered
   - Scenario 3: Application starts but health checks fail
   - Scenario 4: Configuration issue causes failure
   - Scenario 5: Manual rollback to specific version

3. **Metrics to Track**
   - Time to detect failure
   - Time to complete rollback
   - Success rate of automatic rollbacks
   - Data integrity after rollback

## Usage

Detailed usage instructions will be added as scripts are developed.
